# Co-investment

## Investment partners

Who are the cloud companies most often partnering with?

For first pass, plucked out top 20 co-investors for each of the big
three. Table below has 43 rows because of the overlaps. Honestly not
that informative or shocking –

- coinvestors are pretty spread out, there are some repeated partners
  but big three mostly invest by themselves and not with a single
  investment partner
- And they share *some* partners but not a ton – maybe that can be
  exploited to show theyre investing in different things
- Google invests sometimes with MSFT and Amazon, but not a whole lot?

\## GovTech

What kind of govtech firms to Big Cloud invest in?

## Cloud vs Non-Cloud

Compare cloud companies investment strategies to “non-cloud” tech, eg
Meta/Apple, or edge, eg Intel

# Demonstrating Cloud Dependence

## Compared to other companies, Big Cloud invests more times in the same company

## Big Cloud acts as the lead investor in a disproportionate amount of cases

## “Ouroboros” of Cloud

When is Big Cloud are investing in other companies that do cloud infra
(Kubernetes)?

## Dependence of investment receivers on Big Cloud

Can we measure when one Big Cloud co has invested a large amount of
company’s investment total?

(how can we operationalize this given the dataset? Similar to
lead/secondary question?)

## Lead/ secondary: Can we quantify/ describe the difference in target firm when Big Cloud Lead investor vs secondary investor?

# Changes over time

When does Amazon become a cloud company? What about the others? Is there
some “natural” progression? What external data will we need?

# Depending on kind of funding round? Can we test if VC deals are diff than others? Or if amounts are generally bigger when the Big Three invest or lead?

# International and “Third world” development

Would probably be code to incorporate an “all EU” designation if we can
get an easy list of the country codes. Each company receiving investment
is listed once per cloud giant in the table below, so if Google invested
in Asian Company LLC 3 times it’d still only appear once.
