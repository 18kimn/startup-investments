Top-level summary statistics of full dataset

The table below is a bit messy conceptually because it’s processing the
same funding round multiple times often.

| Statistic | Amazon | Google | Microsoft | All investments |

| Total number of deals | 738.0 | 3,493.0 | 1,680.0 | 1,174,990.0 |

| Number of investing aliases | 29.0 | 19.0 | 18.0 | 155,581.0 |
| % of time that they “lead” funding rounds | 62.3 | 65.9 | 16.5 | 29.0 |

# High-level trends

## AI vs Non-AI

## “Ouroboros” of Cloud

When is Big Cloud are investing in other companies that do cloud infra
(Kubernetes)?

# Dependence of investment receivers on Big Cloud

Can we measure when one Big Cloud co has invested a large amount of
company’s investment total?

(how can we operationalize this given the dataset? Similar to
lead/secondary question?)

# GovTech

What kind of govtech firms to Big Cloud invest in?

# Cloud vs Non-Cloud

Compare cloud companies investment strategies to “non-cloud” tech, eg
Meta/Apple, or edge, eg Intel

# Changes over time

When does Amazon become a cloud company? What about the others? Is there
some “natural” progression? What external data will we need?

# Lead/ secondary: Can we quantify/ describe the difference in target firm when Big Cloud Lead investor vs secondary investor?

# Depending on kind of funding round? Can we test if VC deals are diff than others? Or if amounts are generally bigger when the Big Three invest or lead?

# International and “Third world” development

Would probably be code to incorporate an “all EU” designation if we can
get an easy list of the country codes. Each company receiving investment
is listed once per cloud giant in the table below, so if Google invested
in Asian Company LLC 3 times it’d still only appear once.
