```

The table below is a bit messy conceptually because it's processing the same funding round multiple times often.

## Largest investments

These are outliers, generally -- 

```{r}
cloud_investments |> 
  select(name, announced_on, raised_amount_usd) |> 
  slice_max(order_by = raised_amount_usd, n = 20) |> 
  arrange(desc(raised_amount_usd)) |>

```

# Co-investment 

## Investment partners

Who are the cloud companies most often partnering with?

For first pass, plucked out top 20 co-investors for each of the big three. Table below has 43 rows because of the overlaps. Honestly not that informative or shocking -- 

- coinvestors are pretty spread out, there are some repeated partners but big three
  mostly invest by themselves and not with a single investment partner
- And they share _some_ partners but not a ton -- maybe that can be exploited to show theyre investing in different things
- Google invests sometimes with MSFT and Amazon, but not a whole lot?

```{r}

coinvestors <- cloud_investments |> 
  select(cloud_giant, funding_round_uuid) |> 
  left_join(funding_round_participants, by = c("funding_round_uuid" = "uuid")) |> 
  unnest(cols = investor_uuids) |> 
  group_by(cloud_giant, investor_uuids) |> 
  count(name = "n_deals") |> 
  group_by(cloud_giant) |> 
  mutate(pct_deals = round(100 * n_deals / n(), 2)) |> 
  left_join(select(investors, uuid, name), by = c("investor_uuids" = "uuid")) |> 
  # anti-join to filter out 
  anti_join(select(clouds, cloud_giant, name),
            by = c("cloud_giant", "name")) |> 
  arrange(desc(pct_deals)) |> 
  slice_max(order_by = pct_deals, n = 20, with_ties = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(deals = paste0(n_deals, " (", pct_deals, "%)"))

coinvestors |> 
  select(-investor_uuids, -n_deals, -pct_deals) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from=cloud_giant, values_from=deals) |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ifelse(is.na(.), "", .))) |> 
  kable()
```

## GovTech

What kind of govtech firms to Big Cloud invest in?

## Cloud vs Non-Cloud

Compare cloud companies investment strategies to “non-cloud” tech, eg Meta/Apple, or edge, eg Intel

# Impacts of investment

## "Ouroboros" of Cloud

When is Big Cloud are investing in other companies that do cloud infra (Kubernetes)?

## Dependence of investment receivers on Big Cloud

Can we measure when one Big Cloud co has invested a large amount of company’s investment total?

(how can we operationalize this given the dataset? Similar to lead/secondary question?)

## Lead/ secondary: Can we quantify/ describe the difference in target firm when Big Cloud Lead investor vs secondary investor?

# Changes over time

When does Amazon become a cloud company? What about the others? Is there some “natural” progression?
What external data will we need?

# Depending on kind of funding round? Can we test if VC deals are diff than others? Or if amounts are generally bigger when the Big Three invest or lead?

# International and “Third world” development

Would probably be code to incorporate an "all EU" designation if we can get an easy list of the country codes. Each company receiving investment is listed once per cloud giant in the table below, so if Google invested in Asian Company LLC 3 times it'd still only appear once.

There seems to be Third World development / investment arms maintained by the big 3 cloud:

- https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/umbono
- Google’s Africa Investment Fund investment in Series C - Moniepoin
- NCAIR-Google AI Fund: Nigeria investments
- Alibaba?
